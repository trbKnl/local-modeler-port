# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing. When contributing, make sure that the changes you wish to make are in line with the project direction. 
If you are not sure about this, open an issue first, so we can discuss it.

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as to accept pull requests.

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

* Reporting a bug
* Discussing the current state of the code
* Submitting a fix
* Proposing new features

# Report bugs 
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code. Ideally include the following:

1. A quick summary and/or background
2. Steps to reproduce
3. Be specific!
4. Give sample code if you can.
4. What you expected would happen
5. What actually happens
6. Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or things you tried that didn't work)

# Code submission policy
 
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use Github Flow):

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from main.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue the pull request.
